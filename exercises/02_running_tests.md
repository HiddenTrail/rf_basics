# Running test suite in Robot Framework

Robot Framework tests are run in command prompt/terminal or alternatively straight from IDE.

You have created your first test suite in the last exercise. You can use this `.robot` file as and example in this exercise.

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory where the test suite file is located using the cd command.
3. Run the test suite using the robot command followed by the name of the test suite file. For example: robot my_test_suite.robot
4. Robot Framework will run the test suite and output the results in the command prompt or terminal window.

Alternatively, you can run the test suite using an IDE or text editor that has a built-in integration with Robot Framework, such as PyCharm or VS Code.

To run the test suite using an IDE, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the test suite file in your IDE.
2. Open the Run/Debug Configuration dialog.
3. Add a new configuration for Robot Framework.
4. Set the name of the test suite file as the value for the Test suite field.
5. Optionally, you can configure other settings such as the path to the Robot Framework executable and the output directory for the test results.
6. Run the configuration, and the IDE will execute the test suite and display the results in the IDE.

That's it!
