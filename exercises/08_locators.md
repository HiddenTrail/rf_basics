# Locators

 Locators are essentially ways to find specific elements within a web page so that you can interact with them for testing purposes. This allows you to automate actions like clicking buttons, entering text, and reading text from the page. There are several strategies for locating elements, including by ID, name, CSS selector, XPath, and link and button text, among others.

 For example, a locator might look like this:

- By ID: id=username
- By name: name=password
- By CSS selector: css=input[type='submit']
- By XPath: xpath=//input[@type='submit']
- By link text: link=Logout
- By button text: button=Login
